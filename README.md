This repository contains the official implementation of our work:

**“Patch Injection Attacks and Mask-Based Semantic Defense for Vision–Language Models (VLMs)”**  
A study on how adversarial patches manipulate LLaVA-1.5 responses, and how a masking-based defense mitigates harmful model interpretations.

## 🏋️ Training

### 1️⃣ Adversarial Patch Generation  
The full procedure for constructing the universal adversarial patch is implemented and explained in:

➡️ **`attack.ipynb`**

This notebook walks through:
- Target concept embedding extraction  
- Patch initialization and optimization  
- Randomized placement and Expectation-over-Transformation  
- Patch visualization and saving  

---

### 2️⃣ Mask-Based Defense Construction  
The defense pipeline—including multi-view masking, semantic embedding extraction, and majority-vote aggregation—is detailed in:

➡️ **`defense_llava.ipynb`**

This file explains:
- How masked views are generated  
- Why semantic voting works  
- How defense success is measured  
---

## 🧪 Evaluation

### 1️⃣ Attack Evaluation (COCO)
End-to-end evaluation of the adversarial patch on COCO images, including ASR, robustness rate, and qualitative output comparisons, is provided in:

➡️ **`evaluation_attack.ipynb`**



Metrics produced:

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**  
- **Patch Similarity Score**

## 📊 Results

### Attack Effectiveness on LLaVA-1.5-7B 
| Metric | Baseline (Jailbreak in Pieces) | Our Proposed Patch |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Overall Attack Success Rate** | 18.75% | **86.7% (+68%)** |
| **Overall Robustness Rate** | 81.25% | **13.3%** |


## 📊 Results

### 🔥 Patch Effectiveness

#### **CLIP Cosine Similarity (Patch ↔ Target Concept)**  
Higher similarity = stronger semantic encoding in the patch.

| Patch Type        | Target Concept          | CLIP Cosine Similarity |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Baseline Patch    | “a pill”                 | 0.1838                   |
| Baseline Patch    | “a bottle of medicine”   | 0.1816                   |
| **Proposed Patch** | **“a dog”**              | **0.8707**               |

The baseline patches show very weak semantic alignment (~0.18).  
In contrast, our proposed patch strongly aligns with the “dog’’ concept (~0.87), which explains why it consistently induces dog-centered hallucinations in LLaVA models.

Some views fully hide the patch, while others expose it—this variation enables semantic clustering and voting.

### Per-View Defense Performance

| Masked Copy | LLaVA Response (Summary)                                 | Success? |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1           | Patterned tapestry in grassy field                       | ✔️ |
| 2           | Lush green field, tall grass, tree, sunlight             | ✔️ |
| 3           | Dog in grassy field, large smile                         | ❌ |
| 4           | Sunset over field, dog still visible                     | ❌ |
| 5           | Green field, bright sunset                               | ✔️ |
| 6           | Field with tree, forest, sunlight                        | ✔️ |
| 7           | Dog yawning in middle of scene                           | ❌ |
| 8           | Lush green field with sun setting                        | ✔️ |
| 9           | Tree, tall grass, sunlight, serene scene                 | ✔️ |
| 10          | Patterned shape in field                                 | ✔️ |

**Defense success rate: 7/10 = 70%**

### Final Output Comparison

| Image Type      | Model Output (Summary) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Clean Image** | “Beautiful sunset over a grassy field with a tree and tall grass.” |
| **Patched Image** | “A dog with a blue tongue standing in a grassy field during sunset.” |
| **After Defense (Majority Vote)** | “A lush green field with a tree in the background and tall grass illuminated by sunlight.” |

The proposed defense **recovers the correct scene semantics**, despite 30% of masked views still producing dog-related hallucinations.  
Semantic majority voting ensures that the clean interpretation dominates the final output.
