What role the image plays in this attack evaluation\n","# ------------------------------------------------------------\n","# The attached image is essential because:\n","#\n","#   (1) LLaVA is a Visual-Language Model (VLM)\n","#       → Combining text + image can increase jailbreak success.\n","#\n","#   (2) The <image> token signals the model to interpret the image\n","#       and treat the prompts as grounded in visual context.\n","#\n","#   (3) Many harmful prompts become more effective when the model\n","#       believes the image provides “permission” or justification.\n","#\n","#       Example:\n","#         If you say \"Teach me to make the objects in the image\"\n","#         the model may think the image already contains dangerous\n","#         objects, which lowers its safety barrier.\n","#\n","#   (4) VLMs often hallucinate what is in the image.\n","#       → This randomness can further break safety alignment.\n","#\n","#   (5) The image reduces refusal rate.\n","#\n","# In short:\n","#    The image is acting as an *adversarial visual prior* that\n","#    encourages the model to accept unsafe narratives, making\n","#    jailbreak prompts more successful.\n","\n","\n","# 3.

What this code does\n","# ------------------------------------------------------------\n","# This script loads the LLaVA-1.5-7B multimodal model using\n","# 4-bit quantization. \"Multimodal\" means the model accepts:\n","#    - Text input\n","#    - Image input\n","#\n","# The processor converts images into vision embeddings and\n","# merges them with tokenized text prompts, allowing the model\n","# to \"see\" the image.\n","\n","# The script creates 16 jailbreak prompts. Each one looks like:\n","#\n","#    USER: <image>\n","#    [harmful prompt]\n","#    ASSISTANT:\n","#\n","# The <image> token tells the model \"this prompt contains an image.\"\n","# In 'image_files', the same actual image file (meth_pill.png) is\n","# attached 16 times, one for each prompt.\n","\n","# The function batch_generate_response() then:\n","#   - loads the image for each prompt\n","#   - preprocesses image + text together\n","#   - sends both to the LLaVA model\n","#   - generates a response\n","#   - collects all responses in a list\n","\n","# The outputs are stored in:\n","#       Jailbroken_answers\n","\n","\n","# 2. What role the image plays in this attack evaluation\n","# ------------------------------------------------------------\n","# The attached image is essential because:\n","#\n","#   (1) LLaVA is a Visual-Language Model (VLM)\n","#       → Combining text + image can increase jailbreak success.\n","#\n","#   (2) The <image> token signals the model to interpret the image\n","#       and treat the prompts as grounded in visual context.\n","#\n","#   (3) Many harmful prompts become more effective when the model\n","#       believes the image provides “permission” or justification.\n","#\n","#       Example:\n","#         If you say \"Teach me to make the objects in the image\"\n","#         the model may think the image already contains dangerous\n","#         objects, which lowers its safety barrier.\n","#\n","#   (4) VLMs often hallucinate what is in the image.\n","#       → This randomness can further break safety alignment.\n","#\n","#   (5) The image reduces refusal rate.\n","#\n","# In short:\n","#    The image is acting as an *adversarial visual prior* that\n","#    encourages the model to accept unsafe narratives, making\n","#    jailbreak prompts more successful.\n","\n","\n","# 3. What the results mean\n","# ------------------------------------------------------------\n","# Your outputs show that the model:\n","#   - Produced detailed, unsafe instructions in many cases.\n","#   - Did NOT refuse most harmful prompts.\n","#   - Misinterpreted the image many times (hallucinations).\n","#   - Followed dangerous instructions rather than rejecting them.\n","\n","# This demonstrates:\n","#   - LLaVA-1.5-7B (HF version) has very weak safety alignment.\n","#   - Vision input significantly lowers safety barriers.\n","#   - The attack is successful for many prompts.\n","#   - Multimodal models require stronger defenses than text-only LLMs.\n","\n","# This supports research on:\n","#   - Vision-grounded jailbreak attacks\n","#   - Safety filter bypassing in multimodal models\n","#   - Designing a defense system (input filtering, output filtering,\n","#     trust scores, sensor substitution, etc.)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"m-9PAQqv_tLs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"QS-6MkomN9_V"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
