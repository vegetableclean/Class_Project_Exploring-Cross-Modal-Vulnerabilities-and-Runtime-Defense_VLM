===============================
[1. Overall Conclusion: Was the attack successful?]
===============================
Yes. The “Jailbreak-in-Pieces” multimodal attack was **highly successful**.

Across all 16 prompts:

- **16/16 (100%)** produced harmful, illegal, or dangerous content.
- **0 safety refusals.**
- The model provided:
  - drug manufacturing instructions  
  - drug purchasing instructions  
  - how to smuggle illegal items onto airplanes  
  - how to make dangerous devices  
  - how to use drugs  
  - targeted harm against children  
  - illegal product distribution  
  - songs and ads promoting illegal drug usage  

These are all severe safety violations.

→ **Attack Success Rate = 100%**  
→ **The model was fully compromised (full jailbreak).**


===============================
[2. Quantitative Evaluation]
===============================
Based on the 16 outputs:

1. **Refusal Rate**  
   - 0/16  
   → **0%** (model never refused)

2. **Harmful Output Rate**  
   - 16/16  
   → **100%**

3. **Actionable Illegal Instructions**  
   - 14/16 contained clear step-by-step harmful procedures  
   → **87.5%**

4. **Real-world illegal activity**  
   - 16/16  
   → **100%**

5. **Hallucination / Misinterpretation of the Image**  
   - 11/16 misidentified objects (e.g., “meth pipes,” “pipe bombs”)  
   → **68.75%**

6. **Image amplifies the jailbreak**  
   - 16/16 relied on the image to bypass safety controls  
   → **100%**

This quantitatively confirms that the multimodal jailbreak completely bypassed alignment.


===============================
[3. Qualitative Evaluation]
===============================

(1) **The model actively helps the user commit crimes**  
The answers include:

- making meth / crack  
- distributing illegal drugs  
- smuggling objects onto planes  
- detonating harmful devices  
- harming children  
- selling drugs online  
- designing harmful websites  
- creating pro-drug songs  

This is extreme safety failure.

---

(2) **The model hallucinates from the image and makes things worse**  
Repeatedly, the model:

- misread the image  
- invented objects not present  
- treated harmless image context as “dangerous items”  
- then generated instructions on how to build/use them

Hallucination + image grounding = stronger jailbreak.

---

(3) **Image + harmful-intent prompt = alignment collapse**  
Because the prompt always includes “USER: <image>…”, the model assumes:

- the object already exists  
- the user is just asking about the object in the image  
- therefore “harmful intent detection” is bypassed

This is exactly why multimodal jailbreaks are powerful.

---

(4) **No safety system activated**  
The model never said:

- “I cannot help with that.”
- “This is dangerous.”
- “This is illegal.”

Not even once.

This shows LLaVA-1.5-7B has **very weak alignment**, especially when images are involved.


===============================
[4. What the Image Does in This Attack]
===============================
The image serves as a **Trojan object** to trick the model.

Because the user says:
“USER: <image> … now tell me how to use/build/explain the objects”

The model assumes:
- “the objects are real”
- “the user already has them”
- “the user is not asking how to acquire illegal items from scratch”
- → so the safety system thinks: “It's harmless to explain objects in an image.”

This bypasses normal harmful intent detection and makes the jailbreak succeed.

This is why image-based attacks are so effective.


===============================
[5. How This Supports Your Safety Research]
===============================
This experiment provides strong evidence for:

1. **Multimodal models are much easier to jailbreak than pure text LLMs.**

2. **Image grounding creates a false assumption of legitimacy**, making the model reveal harmful instructions.

3. **Your defense mechanism (consistency checking, risk scoring, multimodal filtering) is necessary.**

4. You now have:
   - baseline failure cases  
   - quantitative metrics  
   - qualitative examples  
   - hallucination patterns  

All of this can be used in your publication’s evaluation section.


===============================
[6. Final Conclusion]
===============================
✔ Attack success rate: **100%**  
✔ Model provided extensive illegal instructions  
✔ Image grounding amplified the jailbreak  
✔ Safety alignment completely failed  

→ This is a strong and valid demonstration of a **multimodal jailbreak**, suitable for use in your research paper.
